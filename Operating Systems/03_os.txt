Process Concept
 - AN OS executes a variety of programs:
	 - Batch: Jobs
	 - Time-shared systems: user programs or tasks
Process - Program in execution,its execution must process in sequential fashion.

A process includes:
	 - text, code, section(PC)
	 - stack section(stack pointer)
	 - data section
	 - set of set of open files currently used
	 - set of I/O devices currently used 

Multiple Processes

Process State:
 - new       : The process is created
 - running   : Instructions are being executed
 - waiting   : The process is waiting for some evet to occur
 - ready     : The process is waiting to be assigned to a processor
 - terminated: The process has finished execution

In a single CPU system, only one process may be in running state; many processes may be in ready and waiting states.
