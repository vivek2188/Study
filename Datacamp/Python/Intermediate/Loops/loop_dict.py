'''
In Python 3, you need the items() method to loop over a dictionary:

world = { "afghanistan":30.55,
          "albania":2.77,
          "algeria":39.21 }

for key, value in world.items() :
    print(key + " -- " + str(value))
Remember the europe dictionary that contained the names of some European countries as key and their capitals as corresponding value? Go ahead and write a loop to iterate over it!

# Definition of dictionary
europe = {'spain':'madrid', 'france':'paris', 'germany':'berlin',
          'norway':'oslo', 'italy':'rome', 'poland':'warsaw', 'austria':'vienna' }

# Iterate over europe
for key , value in europe.items():
    print("the capital of " + key + " is " + value)
