Book: GRAPH THEORY WITH APPLICATIONS by J. A. Bondy and U. S. R. Murty 

Chapter 1 - Graph and Subgraph

Graph G is defined as an ordered triple (V,E,psi) where
 - V is a set of non empty set of vertices
 - E is a set, disjoint from V, of edges
 - psi is an incidence function that associates with each edge of an unordered pair of(not necessarily distinct) vertices of G

It merely depicts the incidence relation holding between its vertices and edges.

Planar Graph is a graph whose edges intersects only at their ends otherwise Non-Planar.

Adjacent Edges - Two edges which are incident with a common vertex.
Adjacent Vertices - Two vertices which are incident with a common edge.

An edge with identical ends is a Loop otherwise Link

Finite Graph - Have finite set of vertices and edges.
Trivial Graph  - Have only one vertex.
Simple Graph - Have no loops and no two of its link join same pair of vertices.

v = #Vertices , epsilon = #Edges
A simple graph G can have atmost vC2 number of edges.
