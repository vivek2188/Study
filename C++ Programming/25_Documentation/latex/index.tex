Test input string to see whether they are palindromes.

A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward. To test for palindromes, this program needs to strip punctuation and other non-\/essential characters from the string, and compare letters without regard to case differences.

This program reads lines of text from the standard input and echos to the standard output those lines that are palindromes
