/** @mainpage Palindromes
  * Test input string to see whether they are palindromes.
  *
  * A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward.
  * To test for palindromes, this program needs to strip punctuation and
  * other non-essential characters from the string, and compare letters 
  * without regard to case differences.
  *
  * This program reads lines of text from the standard input and echos 
  * to the standard output those lines that are palindromes
  *
