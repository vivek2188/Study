# Creating Variable

# Create a variable savings
savings = 100        # $100

# Create a variable factor
factor = 1.10

# Calculate result
result = savings * factor**7

# Print out result
print(result)
# Create a variable desc
desc = 'compound interest'

# Create a variable profitable
profitable = True

print('Typr of variable profitable: ',type(profitable))
print('Type of variable desc: ',type(desc))

#OPERATOR WITH MULTIPLE MEANINGS
# Several variables to experiment with
savings = 100
factor = 1.1
desc = "CompoundInterest"

# Assign product of factor and savings to year1
year1 = savings*factor

# Print the type of year1
print('Type of year1: ',type(year1))
# Assign sum of desc and desc to doubledesc
doubledesc = desc + desc
# Print out doubledesc
print(doubledesc)

# Definition of savings and result     TYPE CONVERSIONS
savings = 100
result = 100 * 1.1 ** 7

# Fix the printout
print("I started with $" + str(savings) + " and now have $" + str(result) + ". Awesome!")

# Definition of pi_string
pi_string = "3.1415926"

# Convert pi_string into float: pi_float
pi_float = float(pi_string)
